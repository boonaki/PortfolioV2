# My Portfolio Website
This is the second release and update to my portfolio

**Link to project:** http://boonaki.me

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Responsive, accessible and developed with a mobile first approach, check out the projects I have within my portfolio or use it to get in touch with me!

This project was my first attempt at a mobile-first approach, rather than using media-queries to go from desktop to mobile. Using this approach is far less-complicated than going the opposite way.
