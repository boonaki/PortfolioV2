				<h2>Is your web presence working for you?</h2>
				<p>
					Do you already have a web presence? If someone needs what you provide, will your website draw them in? What will they see when they open the website on a mobile phone?
				</p>

				<p>
					A responsive and accessible web presence is no longer merely a 'bonus' or 'nice to have' — it is essential. Whether that be creating a specifically tailored website from the ground up, or updating an existing presence for the mobile age. I specialize in providing accessible, responsive, and beautiful web designs that act as a place for individuals to find and learn what you have to offer.

						<h3>I'm a Marshallese Software Engineer based in North Carolina</h3>
						<p>I started my career in software development because of an innate passion to break, build and explore. Years of being curious about the inner workings of video games sparked a flame that has pushed me to figure out the how and why behind computer science, and now I have harnessed that passion to build out the projects that I have dreamt about building since I was a child.</p>
						<p>Being able to provide a fulfilling product that I can infuse my creativity, critical thinking and passions into simple,
							elegant and innovative solutions, is what I love to do.</p>
						<p>When I'm not developing websites, you can find me doing various coding challenges, developing & play-testing video games, enjoying other hobbies of mine or just hanging around with my family.</p>
